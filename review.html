    <p>Alfa Kurnia :</p>
      <p>I feel the effect of repairing the skin barrier quickly. A few days after moving to Brunei ,my skin which had adapted to water and weather, started to feel very dry, itchy and had bumps. On the cheeks also appear pimples. After 10 days of using Skintific 5x Ceramide Barrier repair Moisture Cream, my acne disappeared and my skin became smoother.</p>

      <p>Meilinda :</p>
      <p>This is an example of before after in just 1 time use, so the results are instant. What i felt while using it was no pain or heat on my skin, even though my skin is quit sensitive. I felt the most effect is that my skin feels clean, helps clear up the pimples and cleans the pores.</p>

        <p>LianaEka : </p>
        <p>I've been using this for about 10 days, what I like most about this Skintific 5x Ceramide Low pH Cleanser is the fragrance and the foam which is really soft. So when using this, you really feel at home because the foam is soft and after using it, your face immediately feels really fresh, you know.</p>

        <p>Lisa :</p>
        <p>What I noticed the most about this really soothing toner was that yesterday there was a hormonal pimple on my chin, which at that time I didn't have any routine skincare or acne treatment at all, I could only just use this soothing toner, and a few days later The pimples are much calmer, they're not red anymore, and now they're dry and deflated.</p>
